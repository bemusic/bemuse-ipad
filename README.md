Bemuse for iPad (Pro)
=====================

Bemuse version compiled for iPad Pro.


## Technical Overview

This application basically starts a web server that hosts the Bemuse game,
then fires up a SFSafariView view that visits that web page.

__Why SFSafariView, not use PhoneGap or WKWebView?__
This is a very ugly hack.
Because normal iOS apps (including home screen apps generated by Safari) are only allowed to use 600 MB of RAM.
Bemuse game is very RAM intensive. Some song may need more than 1GB of RAM to play (due to large amount of sound data).
When using SFSafariViewController, the web content is displayed by Safari process, which does not have this restriction!
